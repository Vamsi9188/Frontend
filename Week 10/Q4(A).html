    Purpose of z-index in CSS
    The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements that overlap. It only works on elements that have a position value other than static (e.g., absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky). The z-index value determines which element appears "on top" when elements overlap:

    Elements with a higher z-index value will appear in front of elements with a lower z-index.
    If two elements have the same z-index, their stacking order is determined by their order in the HTML document.

<!-- 
Explanation:
Box 1 (z-index: 1): This box is placed at coordinates (50px, 50px) and has a z-index of 1. It will be partially overlapped by Box 2 and Box 3.

Box 2 (z-index: 2): This box is placed at coordinates (100px, 100px) and has the highest z-index (2), so it appears on top of both Box 1 and Box 3.

Box 3 (z-index: 0): This box is placed at coordinates (150px, 150px) and has the lowest z-index (0), so it will be behind both Box 1 and Box 2.

How z-index Affects Layering:
In this example, the z-index values control how the boxes stack when they overlap:

Box 2 appears on top because it has the highest z-index value.
Box 1 is in the middle with a z-index of 1.
Box 3 is at the bottom because it has the lowest z-index.
Without z-index, the default stacking order is determined by the position of the elements in the HTML structure (later elements would typically appear on top of earlier ones if they overlap). Using z-index allows you to control this order explicitly.
