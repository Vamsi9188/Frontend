== is equals operator for comparing values it performs type coersion which means before comparison javascript converts the same type for compare.

ex. console.log(5=='5'); // true
    console.log(true==5);  // true

=== is strictyly equals operator for comparing valus it doesn't perform type coersion which mean it does not convert the values directly compare both values.

ex. console.log(5==='5'); // false
    console.log(true===5); // false


3. Differnce between var,let and const in javascript:

var:
var is used to define a variable which is gloabal scope mean if we declare a variable with var key word the we can access any time and any place in our code. var supports function scope. Once we declare a variable as var then we can redeclare and reassign.

ex. var a=10;
    var a="Vamsi";

let:
let is used to define a variable which is block scope format. Once we declare a variable as let keyword then redeclare is not support in this format and reassignment is possible.

const
