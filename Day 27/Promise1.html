            <dd>A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>A Promise is in one of these states:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>pending:</b>initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
            <li><b>fulfilled:</b>meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</li>
            <li><b>rejected:</b>meaning that the operation failed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The eventual state of a pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options occur, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called. If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.</p>

// promise - represents the outcome of an operation
//  that will be completed in the future

// callback functions - functions which we do not called. They are called automatically
// when certain criteria is met

// document.addEventListener("click",()=>{
// example of callback function
// })


// states of a promise

// 1. pending - Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet. Outcome is not known yet.
// 2. fulfilled - this is the state when the promise is successful.
// 3. rejected - The action related to the promise failed.
// 4. settled - The promise has been fulfilled or rejected. The outcome is known.

// Application of promise

// API - external function which is written somewhere else and you 
// call it from your code/program

// API endpoint - remote functions that you call

// fetch api - provided by the browser which allows you to call external functions
// by providing an address 

const resultPromise = fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/eur.json");


resultPromise.then(outcome => {
    // response
    console.log(outcome);
    // convert this response into a javascript object
    const result = outcome.json();

    // promise - when this promise is resolved it will give us the data as a javascript object
    result.then(res => {
        console.log(res);

    })

})

// JSON 

// Javascript 
// Object
// Notation

// it’s quite similar to the object in javascript.

// but there are a few differences - it’s a string whose structure resembles an object in javascript

// since it’s quite common - we have built in methods in js -

//  ** JSON.stringify ** - converts JS object into JSON

//     ** JSON.parse ** - converts JSON to object in JS
